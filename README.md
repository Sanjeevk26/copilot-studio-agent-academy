# Agent Academy: Copilot Studio Recruit Track

Welcome, Recruit.

This repository is a **practical field manual** for learning how to design, build, and deploy agents using Microsoft Copilot Studio.  
It is intentionally **hands-on**, **tool-first**, and **scenario-driven**—built for people who learn by building, breaking, and fixing.

This is not a theory dump.  
This is training.

---

## What This Repository Is

- A structured **learning path** for Copilot Studio agent development
- A **reference archive** of working patterns, screenshots, and artifacts
- A place to document **real-world gotchas** you only learn by doing
- A foundation for future advanced tracks (Operative, Commander)

Each lesson represents a **mission** with a clear outcome and validation criteria.

---

## What You’ll Build

By the end of the Recruit track, you will have built and deployed:

- A declarative agent grounded in prompts
- A custom agent connected to SharePoint knowledge
- Topic-based conversational paths
- Adaptive Cards with Power Fx
- Agent Flows triggered from card inputs
- Event-driven agent behaviors
- A production-ready deployment to Teams and Microsoft 365 Copilot

Along the way, you’ll also learn how Copilot Studio fits into the broader Microsoft 365 and Power Platform ecosystem.

## Required Access

You will need access to the following to complete all missions:

- Microsoft 365 Developer tenant  
- SharePoint Online enabled  
- Copilot Studio (trial or licensed)  

Helpful but optional:
