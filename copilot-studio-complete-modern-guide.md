## The Single Example Used Throughout

### Scenario: Enterprise IT Operations Copilot

An organization wants a **single AI assistant** that employees can use from:
- Microsoft 365 Copilot
- Microsoft Teams

The assistant must:
- Answer IT questions
- Use company-approved knowledge
- Trigger real IT workflows
- Follow enterprise security rules
- Be auditable and governable

This assistant is built entirely using **Microsoft Copilot Studio**.

---

## 1. Declarative Agents (Core Concept)

### What a Declarative Agent Is

A declarative agent is a **governed extension of Microsoft 365 Copilot**.

Key characteristics:
- Instruction-driven, not conversation-scripted
- Lives inside Microsoft 365 Copilot
- Uses Copilot’s reasoning engine
- Operates within tenant security boundaries

Declarative agents **do not replace Copilot** — they **specialize it**.

---

### In Our Example

The organization creates a declarative agent named:

**Enterprise IT Operations Copilot**

Its declared responsibility:
- IT troubleshooting
- Policy-aligned responses
- Workflow delegation

It does *not* attempt to be a general assistant.

---

## 2. Instructions (Behavior Control Layer)

### What Instructions Actually Do

Instructions are **persistent behavioral constraints**, not prompts.

They control:
- Scope (what the agent should and should not answer)
- Tone (professional, empathetic, concise)
- Formatting (steps, bullets, summaries)
- Tool usage rules
- Escalation boundaries

Instructions are always active.

---

### In Our Example

Instructions enforce:
- Step-by-step troubleshooting
- No guessing when confidence is low
- Mandatory escalation for security issues
- Friendly but professional IT tone

This ensures:
- Predictable answers
- Reduced hallucinations
- Consistent employee experience

---

## 3. Tools (Capability Extension Layer)

Copilot answers questions by default.  
**Tools are how it performs actions or specialized reasoning.**

Copilot Studio currently supports:
- Prompt tools
- Power Automate actions
- Connectors
- APIs

---

### 3.1 Prompt Tools (Reasoning Modules)

#### What Prompt Tools Are

Prompt tools are **reusable intelligence blocks**.

They:
- Accept structured input
- Produce controlled output
- Are invoked conditionally
- Do not manage conversations

Think of them as **specialized expert brains**.

---

#### In Our Example

A prompt tool called **IT Diagnostics Engine** is created.

It:
- Takes a device issue as input
- Returns structured troubleshooting steps
- Avoids deep jargon unless required

Agent instruction:
> When a device-related issue is detected, invoke IT Diagnostics Engine.

---

### 3.2 Action Tools (Power Automate)

#### What Actions Are

Actions allow Copilot to **do real work**:
- Reset passwords
- Create tickets
- Check device compliance
- Call external systems

These are usually implemented using **Power Automate flows**.

Important distinction:
- Copilot decides **when**
- Power Automate defines **how**

---

#### In Our Example

Actions include:
- Password reset flow
- Device compliance check
- IT service ticket creation

Copilot never executes actions blindly — intent and permissions are checked first.

---

## 4. Knowledge Sources (Grounding Layer)

### What Knowledge Means in Copilot Studio

Knowledge sources **ground responses in trusted enterprise data**.

Supported sources include:
- SharePoint
- OneDrive
- Dataverse
- Other Microsoft 365 content

Security trimming is automatic.

---

### In Our Example

The agent is grounded on:
- IT SOP documents
- Security policy pages
- Device onboarding manuals

Result:
- Answers are accurate
- Access respects user permissions
- No custom RAG pipeline required

---

## 5. Orchestration (Decision Intelligence)

### What Modern Copilot Does Automatically

Copilot Studio performs **dynamic orchestration**.

At runtime, Copilot decides:
- Answer directly
- Invoke a prompt tool
- Trigger an action
- Escalate or refuse

This happens **without flowcharts or dialog trees**.

---

### In Our Example

User says:
> “My laptop won’t boot after yesterday’s update.”

Copilot:
1. Classifies intent (device issue)
2. Retrieves relevant knowledge
3. Invokes diagnostic prompt
4. Determines if action is required
5. Responds with guided steps

No explicit conversation design exists.

---

## 6. Developer Mode (Observability)

### Why Developer Mode Matters

Developer mode shows:
- Which tools were invoked
- Why they were selected
- How instructions were applied

Commands:
- developer on
- developer off


---

### In Our Example

Developer mode is used to:
- Validate correct prompt selection
- Ensure no unintended actions fire
- Debug orchestration behavior

This is essential for:
- Enterprise validation
- Production readiness
- Consultant troubleshooting

---

## 7. Publishing & Channels (Experience Layer)

Declarative agents can be published to:
- Microsoft 365 Copilot
- Microsoft Teams

Publishing ≠ availability.

---

### In Our Example

The agent:
- Appears as an extension inside Microsoft 365 Copilot
- Appears as an app inside Microsoft Teams

Actual access depends on **tenant policies**, not the agent itself.

---

## 8. Governance & Security (Control Layer)

### The Reality of Copilot Studio

Copilot Studio is **policy-first**.

Controls include:
- App setup policies
- Environment permissions
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Microsoft 365 security boundaries

---

### In Our Example

Initial Teams error:

Permissions needed. Ask your IT admin.


Root cause:
- Custom apps disabled in Teams App Setup Policy

Fix:
- Teams Admin Center → App setup policies → Enable custom apps

Key lesson:
> Successful publishing does not guarantee usability.

---

## 9. Analytics & Continuous Improvement

Copilot Studio provides:
- Usage analytics
- Invocation patterns
- Failure insights

---

### In Our Example

Analytics reveal:
- Frequent password reset requests
- Repeated compliance issues

Outcome:
- New automation added
- Improved prompts created
- Reduced IT ticket volume

---

## 10. The Correct Mental Model

Think in layers:

1. Declarative Agent — What the assistant *is*
2. Instructions — How it behaves
3. Knowledge — What it knows
4. Tools — What it can do
5. Orchestration — How it decides
6. Governance — What is allowed
7. Analytics — How it improves

If you understand these layers, you understand Copilot Studio.
