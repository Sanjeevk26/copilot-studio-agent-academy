# Lesson 05 – Deploying and Customizing a Pre-Built Agent (Safe Travels)

---

## Overview

In this lesson, we explore **Pre-Built Agents (Agent Templates)** in Copilot Studio.

Instead of building an agent from scratch, we use a Microsoft-provided template called **Safe Travels**. This allows us to understand how templates are structured, how they use generative AI, and how knowledge sources can be extended.

This lesson demonstrates how to:

- Deploy a pre-built agent template
- Enable generative AI capabilities
- Add external knowledge sources
- Test and publish the agent

---

## What Are Pre-Built Agents?

Pre-built agents are ready-made AI agents created by Microsoft to solve common business scenarios.

They:

- Address common business needs (Travel, HR, IT, etc.)
- Include pre-configured topics and trigger phrases
- Contain sample instructions and knowledge sources
- Can be edited and customized
- Support additional grounding with enterprise data

They are ideal for:

- Rapid deployment
- Learning agent structure
- Accelerating time-to-value
- Reducing development effort

---

## Use Case in This Lesson

We deploy the **Safe Travels** agent template.

The Safe Travels agent helps users:

- Understand travel requirements
- Check visa policies
- Locate embassies
- Get passport-related information
- Prepare for international business travel

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the purpose of pre-built agents
- Deploy the Safe Travels template
- Customize instructions and knowledge
- Enable generative AI answers
- Test agent grounding
- Publish the agent
- Optionally deploy to Teams

---

## Key Concepts Covered

- Agent templates
- Generative AI in Copilot Studio
- Knowledge grounding (public websites)
- Testing using the Activity Map
- Publishing workflow
- Channel configuration

---

## Bonus Objective

Enhance the Safe Travels agent by grounding it with:

- A SharePoint site
- A corporate travel policy document
- An internal FAQ file

This improves relevance and aligns the agent with your organization’s policies.

---

## Outcome

At the end of this lesson:

- A Safe Travels agent is deployed
- Generative AI is enabled
- Public knowledge source added
- Agent tested and validated
- Agent published successfully
