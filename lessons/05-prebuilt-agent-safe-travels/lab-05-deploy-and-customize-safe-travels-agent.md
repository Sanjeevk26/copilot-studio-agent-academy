Try the following prompts:

- “Do I need a visa to travel from the US to Amsterdam?”
- “How long does it take to get a US Passport?”
- “Where is the closest US embassy in Valencia, Spain?”

Observe:

- Accuracy of responses
- Helpfulness
- Activity Map (to verify grounding source)

Confirm responses are relevant and contextual.
